    HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is the standard language used to design and structure content on the web.  
    With HTML, you can create headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and much more.  
    It forms the basic building block of all web pages and works alongside CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.
